        <p >Hello, my name is Peejay. I have had a curiosity for all things<br>
        technology since I was a child. This fascination with tech has led<br>
        me to software development.
        </P>

        <p >
            I've gone through many career changes and followed several paths<br>
            while trying to figure out what career would I would be happiest<br>
            in. For a long while I wanted to be in sports, either as a player<br>
            or as a coach. Then physical therapy and sports training became a<br>
            big interest of mine. However, I always found myself falling back<br>
            to technology. Seeing this as a sign, I began the system<br>
            administration, networking, and security path. As I studied for<br>
            certifications in I.T. I became intrigued by software engineering.<br>
            At I first I was intimidated by the subject matter. Many doubts<br>
            arose, from wondering if I was good enough with math or if I needed<br>
            a college degree to get in the field. After much research and<br>
            deliberation, I found that software development was not only within<br>
            my capabilities, but there was no better time than now to get in to it<br>
        </p>

        <P>
        Getting to where I want to be is going to take time and<br>
        a lot of hard work. But I'm ready for the challenge.<br>
        Please feel free to follow me on my <br>
        journey to become a software developer.<br>
